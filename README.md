# Weather Watchface for Pebble
This is a really simple watchface for Pebble. It's based on the [official watchface tutorial](https://developer.getpebble.com/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/).

I was asked to upload this code during a Pebble developer meetup in Toronto, as the official tutorial was outdated.
